# SignSense: An Android-Based Application for Real Time Traffic Sign Detection with Voice Alert System and Temporal Data Integration

Signsense is an Android application designed to detect traffic signs in real-time. Using YOLOv8 algorithm, the application helps drivers stay informed and make safer decisions by identifying traffic signs as they are encountered on the road. It also estimates the distance of the detected signs, then providing timely voice alerts.




## Features

- Real-time Detection: Detects various traffic signs in real-time using the device's camera.
- User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design that allows users to quickly start the detection process.
- Notifications: Provides voice alerts to the users with the detected sign, and its distance.

## Technologies Used

- Android Studio: Development platform for building the mobile application.
- TensorFlow Lite: For running the machine learning model on mobile devices.
- Kotlin: Primary programming language used for developing the entire application.
