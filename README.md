# SignSense: An Android-Based Application for Real Time Traffic Sign Detection with Voice Alert System and Temporal Data Integration

Signsense is an Android application designed to detect traffic signs in real-time. Using YOLOv8 algorithm, the application helps drivers stay informed and make safer decisions by identifying traffic signs as they are encountered on the road. It also estimates the distance of the detected signs, then providing timely voice alerts.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Detects various traffic signs in real time using the device's camera.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive design that allows users to quickly start the detection process.
- **Voice Alerts**: Provides voice alerts with the detected sign and its estimated distance.
- **Distance Estimation**: Calculates and informs users about the distance of the detected traffic sign from the car.

## Technologies Used
- **Android Studio**: The development platform for building the mobile application.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For running the machine learning model efficiently on mobile devices.
- **YOLOv8**: The algorithm used for real-time object detection of traffic signs.
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for developing the entire application.

## Installation

Clone the repository.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/meidevilla/SignSense-Application
